# Get Started
To Start the program, run the numberRec.py file. View the results in the console. Watch the program learn while being trained with thousands of data samples. 

# Behind the Scenes
Developed a scalable feed forward neural network for number recognition, with an easily adjustable number of layers, number of cells per layer, and activation function, using vanilla Python
Trained using the MNIST dataset and gradient descent to achieve an average accuracy of 96 %
